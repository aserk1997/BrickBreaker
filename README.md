# BrickBreaker
 My goal when making brickbreak was to use a few things from the other games. One of the things I used is isKinectic to make the paddle move. I also used onTrigger to make the paddle shot the ball when click on with the mouse. I also altered the physics of the ball to make it defy gravity and shot up I achieved my goals by making a game that uses these components.
